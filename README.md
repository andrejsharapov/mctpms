## How it works?

> [!NOTE]  
> This repo contains models of blocks and items, but does not contain ready-made textures (images) for them.

You can study the models you need yourself, for example, a [crafting table](https://github.com/andrejsharapov/mctpms/blob/main/assets/minecraft/models/block/crafting_table.json) model, copy the files and use them in your texture pack with your images.

To create more complex models, you can use the [mine-campfire](https://github.com/andrejsharapov/mine-campfire/tree/main/assets/minecraft) package as an example.

## Releases

- [ ] 1.22.x

## What version of the pack do I have?

See the pack version in the description:

```js
{
  "pack": {
    "description": "ðŸ¦„ MCTPMS for Minecraft JE v1.gg.g \n\u00A73Realistic 3d textures \u00A78v3.p.pp"
  }
}
```

`v1.gg.g` - game version  
`v3.p.pp` - pack version

## How to update to the latest version?

We try to update the package version in a timely manner, but if you see that the game version has changed, you can update the package yourself.

1. Unzip `mctpms.zip` file with textures;
2. Find and open `pack.mcmeta` through text editor;
3. Change `pack_format` to the [latest version](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pack_format#List_of_resource_pack_formats) of the game.

```js
{
  "pack": {
    "pack_format": 42,
  }
}
```

## Bugs
